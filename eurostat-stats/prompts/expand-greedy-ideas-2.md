## 10 NEW Greedy Ideas

---

### 1. The Shame Index: Europe's Worst Performers

**What:** A weekly auto-generated "Wall of Shame" highlighting the countries with the worst stats in each category — bottom 3 in unemployment, GDP growth, emissions, etc.

**Why it's greedy:** Negative news spreads faster than positive news. "Greece ranked worst in youth unemployment for the 10th year" triggers outrage, sharing, and debate. Media loves controversy. The people who hate the ranking will share it even more than those who agree. Shame is visceral.

**Max version:** Weekly auto-refreshed page. Historical shame streaks ("Italy has been in the Bottom 3 for emissions for 8 consecutive years"). "Redemption Arc" section showing countries that climbed out of shame. Comment/reaction system. Push notifications when your country enters the shame list. Media embeddable widgets.

**Min version:** Single page: "Europe's Worst Performers This Year." Three sections (Economy, Environment, Social). For each, show bottom 3 countries with flags and the actual numbers. Bold red styling. Shareable link. Update manually with each data refresh.

---

### 2. The "How Screwed Is Your Future?" Calculator

**What:** Input your age and country. Get a personalized projection: pension outlook, housing affordability, job market predictions, climate impact by the time you retire.

**Why it's greedy:** Personal anxiety drives engagement. Young people worry about pensions and housing. This makes abstract data viscerally personal. "I put in my age and country and it says my pension will be 40% less than my parents'" — that's a tweet. That's a Reddit post. That's an argument at dinner.

**Max version:** Full demographic simulator. Input age, profession, income bracket. Get personalized projections with confidence intervals. "Move to X country to improve your outlook by Y%." Compare your future with your parents' generation at your age. Downloadable "Future Report."

**Min version:** Age + country dropdowns. Show 4-5 key projections: pension sustainability index, youth unemployment trend, housing price-to-income ratio, demographic dependency ratio. Traffic light colors (green/yellow/red). "Based on current trends, by 2050..." statements. Share button.

---

### 3. The EU Divorce Tracker: Brexit Aftermath

**What:** Dedicated page comparing UK vs EU-27 performance since Brexit (2016 referendum, 2020 exit). Trade, GDP, immigration, investment — side by side.

**Why it's greedy:** Brexit is the most divisive political topic in recent European history. Both sides want data to prove they were right. This feature will be cited in arguments. It's evergreen controversy fuel. "Actually, the data shows..." is irresistible for millions of people.

**Max version:** Full interactive comparison tool. Timeline showing key Brexit events with data impacts. Sector-by-sector breakdown (finance, manufacturing, agriculture). "What if UK stayed?" counterfactual projections. Expert quotes. Sentiment analysis of UK vs EU economic news coverage.

**Min version:** One page: "UK vs EU Since Brexit." Split-screen design. 5 key metrics compared: GDP growth, trade balance, foreign investment, labor market, inflation. Simple before/after (2016 vs 2024). Color-coded who's "winning" each metric. Share button designed for Twitter/LinkedIn.

---

### 4. The Generational Betrayal Index

**What:** Compare what Boomers had at age 30 vs what Millennials/Gen-Z have at age 30 — unemployment, housing affordability, wage purchasing power, pension contributions.

**Why it's greedy:** Generational war is internet catnip. Young people feel economically squeezed. This gives them data ammunition. "Boomers at 30 could buy a house on 3x salary. Gen-Z needs 12x." That's viral content. It's emotionally charged, shareable, and sparks debate.

**Max version:** Interactive generational calculator. Pick your birth year, see what economic reality was for people your age across decades. Animated timeline showing divergence. Country-by-country breakdown. "OK Boomer" shareable cards with specific stats. Media-ready infographics.

**Min version:** Single comparison page: Boomer (born 1955) vs Millennial (born 1990) at age 30. 5 key metrics: unemployment rate, median wage vs house price, pension landscape, education costs, job security. Bar chart comparisons. Red/green indicators. Pre-made share cards.

---

### 5. The EU Power Rankings: Monthly Update

**What:** A sports-style power ranking of all EU countries, updated monthly. Like ESPN's NFL Power Rankings but for economies. Editorial takes on who's rising, falling, and why.

**Why it's greedy:** Sports fans check power rankings religiously. Apply that format to countries and people will come back every month. The editorial voice ("Germany drops to #4 after disappointing industrial production") makes it feel alive and opinionated. Rankings are inherently shareable.

**Max version:** Monthly auto-generated rankings with AI commentary. Historical ranking tracker. "Team pages" for each country with full stats. Movement arrows and trend sparklines. Power ranking by category (Economic Power, Green Power, Social Power). Newsletter signup for monthly updates. Prediction market: "Where will X rank next month?"

**Min version:** Static monthly ranking of Top 10 EU economies. Short paragraph per country explaining their rank. Up/down arrows from last month. Published as a blog-style post dated each month. Archive of past months for comparison. Social share optimized.

---

### 6. The "Why Are We So Different?" Divergence Detector

**What:** Pick two similar countries (Spain vs Italy, Sweden vs Finland, Poland vs Czech Republic). See a detailed breakdown of where they diverged and when.

**Why it's greedy:** Neighbors comparing themselves to neighbors is endless content. Greeks want to know why Portugal recovered faster. Poles want to know why Czechs have higher wages. This creates national conversation fodder. Local media will embed it.

**Max version:** AI-powered divergence analysis. "Spain and Portugal were similar in 2000. Here's where they split." Interactive timeline with decision points (policy changes, EU funding decisions, external shocks). Counterfactual: "If Spain had Portugal's approach, they'd be here." Deep-dive reports per comparison.

**Min version:** Curated pairs of similar countries. Click a pair, see 5 charts showing where they diverged. Simple before/after comparison (2000 vs 2024). "Key divergence: Spain's housing bubble, Portugal's austerity." Short text explanations. Share button per comparison.

---

### 7. The "Will X Ever Catch Y?" Convergence Calculator

**What:** Pick two countries. The calculator projects when (or if) the lagging country will catch the leading one based on current growth rates.

**Why it's greedy:** "When will Poland catch Germany in GDP per capita?" is a question millions of Polish people have thought about. The answer — whether hopeful or devastating — is highly shareable. It creates national pride or galvanizes change. It's the sports equivalent of "championship window."

**Max version:** Full convergence/divergence simulator. Multiple scenarios (optimistic/realistic/pessimistic). "What growth rate would X need to catch Y by 2035?" reverse calculator. Animated race visualization over time. Compare to historical catch-ups (South Korea catching Japan, etc.).

**Min version:** Two-country picker. Shows current values and gap. Based on trailing 10-year growth rates, projects forward. "At current rates, Romania will catch Portugal in GDP per capita by 2041." If diverging: "At current rates, the gap will never close." Simple line chart with projection. Share button.

---

### 8. The "What Everyone Gets Wrong" Myth Buster

**What:** A collection of common misconceptions about European countries, debunked with actual data. "Germans work the longest hours" (FALSE: they work among the shortest). "Greece is the laziest country" (FALSE: they work more hours than Germans).

**Why it's greedy:** Myth-busting is viral gold. People love sharing "Actually..." content. It makes them feel smart. It challenges stereotypes. It generates arguments. Every misconception debunked is a shareable moment. Correct the ignorance = get shares from the vindicated.

**Max version:** Interactive myth database. Search by country or topic. User-submitted myths to debunk. Voting on "most believed myths." Shareable cards per myth. "Myth of the Week" feature. Integration with quiz mode.

**Min version:** Top 10 EU Economic Myths, debunked. Each myth gets a card: Myth, Reality, The Data. Pre-made shareable images. Example: "MYTH: Southern Europeans are lazy. REALITY: Greece works more annual hours than Germany, Denmark, or the Netherlands."

---

### 9. The EU Budget Breakdown: Where Does YOUR Money Go?

**What:** Interactive visualization of EU budget flows. See how much your country pays in, gets out, and what the money funds. Find out if you're a "net contributor" or "net beneficiary."

**Why it's greedy:** EU budget debates are contentious. "We pay in X billion and only get Y back!" is political dynamite. People want to see the numbers. Both Eurosceptics and pro-EU folks will share this — to either complain or justify. Follow the money = engagement.

**Max version:** Full Sankey diagram showing budget flows. Click any program to see which countries benefit most. Historical trends (has your country's net position changed?). Per-capita calculations. "What €100 of your taxes funds" breakdown. Compare your country to others.

**Min version:** Simple bar chart: EU countries ranked by net contribution (+ or -). "Germany: +€12B net contributor. Poland: -€9B net beneficiary." Explainer text. Link to official EU budget sources. Shareable summary card per country.

---

### 10. The Real-Time Recession Radar

**What:** Dashboard showing real-time recession risk indicators for each EU country. Green (safe), yellow (warning), red (recession imminent/active). Based on leading indicators.

**Why it's greedy:** Recession anxiety is always high. People obsessively check economic news during uncertainty. A visual "recession radar" is instantly understandable and scarier than raw data. Media will screenshot and share it. It's the economic equivalent of a weather warning map.

**Max version:** Live dashboard updating with each data release. Historical accuracy tracker ("our radar predicted Greece 2011 recession 6 months early"). Push notifications for status changes. Sector breakdown (which industries are flagging?). "What to watch" leading indicators explained. Compare to official forecasts.

**Min version:** Static page updated monthly. All EU countries in a simple grid. Three colors: green/yellow/red. Based on 3 indicators: GDP trend, unemployment trend, consumer confidence. Click country for brief explanation. "Last updated: X" timestamp. Share button for the full map.

## The Controversy Test

Before building, ask:

> "Will this make someone angry enough to share it proving it wrong — or proud enough to share it proving it right?"

If both camps will share, build it immediately.

## What Makes Round 2 Different

Round 1 focused on **games, tools, and visualizations** (quizzes, time machines, maps).

Round 2 focuses on **controversy, anxiety, and identity** (shame, fear, national pride, generational conflict).

Both are valid "greedy" strategies. Round 2 is darker — but darkness spreads faster on the internet.

Choose based on brand:
- If you want to be "the fun EU data site" → Build Round 1.
- If you want to be "the EU data site everyone argues about" → Build Round 2.

The most successful outcome: Build both. Hook with controversy, retain with tools.
