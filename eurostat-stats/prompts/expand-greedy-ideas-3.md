## 10 NEW Greedy Ideas

---

### 1. The 30-Second EU Briefing (Daily Auto-Generated)

**What:** A single-screen, auto-generated daily briefing showing the 3 most interesting data movements in Europe today. Updates automatically. Takes 30 seconds to read.

**Why it's greedy:** Nobody has time. But everyone has 30 seconds. A daily habit-forming feature that people check like they check weather or stock prices. It's the "TL;DR of Europe" — shareable, snackable, addictive. News sites will embed it. People will screenshot it. Morning scroll fodder.

**Max version:** Daily push notification with the briefing. AI-generated commentary on what the data means. "Good morning. Here's Europe today." vibe. Personalized by your saved countries. Archive of past briefings searchable. "What did Europe look like on your birthday?" feature. Audio version for commuters.

**Min version:** Auto-refreshing landing widget on homepage. Three cards: "Biggest Mover" (country with largest YoY change), "Surprise of the Day" (unexpected data point vs trend), "Record Alert" (any country hitting an all-time high/low). Static design with flags and big numbers. Share button per card.

---

### 2. Europe vs USA: The Stats Showdown

**What:** Head-to-head comparison of EU aggregate vs USA on every major metric — GDP, healthcare, crime, inequality, environment, quality of life.

**Why it's greedy:** Americans and Europeans endlessly argue about whose system is better. Twitter threads go viral every time someone posts "EU vs US" stats. This page becomes the definitive, data-driven battlefield. Both sides share it — to prove they're right. It's the Brexit Tracker but for the Atlantic divide.

**Max version:** Interactive dashboard with 50+ metrics. Category filters (Economy, Health, Crime, Environment, Inequality). "Who's winning?" scoreboard with tally. Historical trends (was the gap bigger in 2000?). State-by-state vs country-by-country drill-down. Controversial metrics that vary by how you measure (healthcare quality vs cost vs access).

**Min version:** One page, 10 key metrics. Split-screen: EU flag vs US flag. For each metric, show who "wins" with a checkmark. Mix of metrics where EU wins (healthcare, inequality, environment) and US wins (GDP per capita, entrepreneurship) to stay balanced but contentious. Shareable summary card: "EU 6, USA 4."

---

### 3. The Cost of Your Country (Monthly Burn Rate)

**What:** Interactive calculator showing the cost of living in each EU country — rent, food, transport, utilities, taxes. "How much does it cost to exist in X per month?"

**Why it's greedy:** Millions of Europeans are considering relocating for work or retirement. "Cost of living" searches are massive. Remote workers want to know where their money goes furthest. This is both useful and shareable: "I could live like a king in Portugal for what I pay for a shoebox in Amsterdam."

**Max version:** Full cost of living simulator. Input your income, see your disposable income after taxes and expenses per country. "If you made €50K, here's your life in Spain vs Germany." Lifestyle toggles (city center vs suburbs, car vs no car, eating out vs cooking). Side-by-side country comparisons. "Best value" rankings.

**Min version:** Grid of EU countries with monthly cost estimate (single person, average lifestyle). Based on Eurostat price indices and harmonized data. Click a country for breakdown: Rent 40%, Food 20%, Transport 15%, etc. Simple donut chart per country. "This costs €2,400/month in Germany but €1,100/month in Bulgaria."

---

### 4. The "One Chart That Explains Everything" Series

**What:** Curated collection of the most striking, story-telling charts from the data. Each chart has a provocative title and tells a complete story in one glance. "Why Southern Europe Never Recovered." "The Nordic Exception." "Germany's Dependency Crisis."

**Why it's greedy:** Great charts go viral. The "one chart" format is proven Twitter/LinkedIn gold. Saves users from having to find the interesting angles themselves — we do the editorializing. Each chart is a self-contained shareable piece. Journalists steal these for articles. Professors use them in lectures.

**Max version:** Weekly new chart added to the collection. Community submissions. "Chart of the Week" feature. Download as presentation-ready PNG or SVG. Behind-the-chart explainer articles. "How I made this chart" for data nerds.

**Min version:** 10 curated "killer charts" on a gallery page. Each chart has: attention-grabbing title, the visualization, 2-sentence explanation, source link, share buttons. Example: "The Great Divergence: East vs West Europe Since 1990" with GDP per capita lines. Pre-made social-optimized images.

---

### 5. The Country Horoscope (Tongue-in-Cheek Data Personality)

**What:** Enter your country (or birth country), get a "data horoscope" — a personality profile based purely on statistics. "You're German: disciplined economy, aging population, loves manufacturing, terrible at startups."

**Why it's greedy:** Horoscopes are absurdly popular because people love content about themselves. National stereotypes are endlessly entertaining. This is a fun, shareable, slightly offensive feature that turns dry data into personality content. "OMG this is so accurate" engagement even though it's just Eurostat data.

**Max version:** Full personality quiz format. Multiple countries for "compatibility" check ("Spain + Germany: 34% economic compatibility"). Comparison to other countries ("You're most similar to Austria"). Shareable card with your country's "data personality." Monthly updates as new data changes the profile. Tongue-in-cheek relationship advice for countries.

**Min version:** Single page: pick a country from dropdown. Get 5 "personality traits" derived from data. Example for Italy: "Drama Queen (high government debt), Family-Oriented (low fertility but multi-generational households), Tourist Trap (high tourism GDP share), Work-Life Balance (siesta culture stats), Slow and Steady (low GDP growth)." Shareable image card.

---

### 6. The "Where Should I Move?" Decision Engine

**What:** Answer 5 questions about your priorities (weather, cost, jobs, safety, culture). Get a ranked list of EU countries that match your preferences, backed by data.

**Why it's greedy:** Relocation content is engagement gold. Everyone fantasizes about moving somewhere else. This turns abstract data into actionable advice. Highly shareable results ("The algorithm says I should move to Estonia"). Useful enough to bookmark. Media will write about it.

**Max version:** 20-question comprehensive quiz. Weighted scoring algorithm. Job market match by industry. Visa/residency information. Cost of living adjustment for your income level. "People like you moved to..." testimonial integration. Save and compare multiple scenarios. Shareable "Move Match" certificate.

**Min version:** 5 simple questions with sliders or buttons. Questions: Weather preference (warm/cold), Cost sensitivity (cheap/premium), Work-life balance vs career growth, City vs nature, Language flexibility. Scoring weights each against real data. Show top 3 matches with key stats. "You matched 87% with Portugal." Share button.

---

### 7. The Real-Time Data Race (Live Counter Display)

**What:** Big, bold, live-updating counters showing Europe's key stats in real time — babies born today, tons of CO2 emitted, euros in GDP generated, tourists arriving. Numbers ticking up every second.

**Why it's greedy:** Live counters are mesmerizing. People watch them for no reason. The worldometers.info model works — make dry statistics feel alive and urgent. This is the "keep tab open in background" feature. Screenshot fodder. Makes abstract numbers tangible and visceral.

**Max version:** Full dashboard of 20+ live counters. Compare countries side by side (Germany's CO2 vs France's). "This year so far" vs "Today" vs "Right now" toggles. Sound effects option. Dark mode for permanent display. Embeddable widgets for other sites. Historical comparison ("Same time last year: X").

**Min version:** Hero section on homepage with 4 live counters. Babies born in EU today (calculated from fertility rates), CO2 emitted (from emissions data), GDP generated (from GDP/second), EU debt (from debt data). Use known rates + time elapsed since midnight. Dramatic large font. Optional ticker sound. Screenshot-friendly design.

---

### 8. The "Ask the Data" Natural Language Query

**What:** Type a question in plain English — "What country has the lowest unemployment?" "How does Spain compare to Italy on GDP?" — and get an instant answer with a chart.

**Why it's greedy:** ChatGPT taught everyone to expect natural language interfaces. This is magic: ask a question, get an answer. No dropdowns, no learning the interface. Feels futuristic. Every question answered is a potential share. Democratizes access to data for non-technical users.

**Max version:** Full NLP-powered query engine. Handles complex questions ("Show me countries where unemployment dropped but GDP also dropped"). Suggests follow-up questions. Learns from popular queries. Voice input. "Ask the same question about a different country." Chat-style interface with history.

**Min version:** Curated set of 50 common questions mapped to pre-built queries. Fuzzy matching on keywords ("unemployment" → unemployment dataset, "lowest" → bottom ranking). Returns a simple card with the answer and mini-chart. "I understood: Show lowest unemployment. Here's the answer." Falls back gracefully when confused: "Try one of these questions instead."

---

### 9. The Social Proof Feed (Who's Looking at What)

**What:** Real-time feed showing what other visitors are currently viewing. "Someone in Berlin just looked at Germany vs Poland GDP." "Trending now: Youth Unemployment." Creates social proof and discovery.

**Why it's greedy:** Social proof is powerful. "100 people are viewing this" makes content feel important. This gamifies browsing — what are others interested in? Creates FOMO and discovery. Surfaces interesting datasets you might not have found. Makes a solo activity feel communal.

**Max version:** Full activity feed with pseudo-anonymized locations ("Viewer from Madrid"). "Most viewed today" leaderboard. "Trending topics" section. Integration with Signal Feed. Push popular views to homepage. "X people viewed this in the last hour" badges on charts.

**Min version:** Simple "Trending Now" widget in sidebar. Shows top 5 datasets viewed in last hour. Anonymous counter: "47 people are exploring data right now." Rotate through recent popular country comparisons. Click to view trending item. No real tracking needed — can use simple server-side session counts or even simulated popularity based on Google Trends.

---

### 10. The "Make It Viral" Card Generator

**What:** Tool to turn any chart into a perfectly formatted, social-media-optimized shareable card. Choose template, add title, export in 1080x1080 or 16:9. One-click post to Twitter/LinkedIn.

**Why it's greedy:** Most sharing fails because the format is wrong. Screenshots look ugly. The PNG export is sized wrong for social. This solves the friction between "I found cool data" and "I posted cool data." Every card generated is potential viral content with your watermark. Multiplies the reach of all other features.

**Max version:** Full design studio. 10+ templates (minimalist, bold, infographic-style). Custom branding upload. Add your own annotations and highlights. Auto-generate provocative captions. Direct Twitter/LinkedIn API integration. "Scheduled posts" feature. Analytics: see how your cards perform.

**Min version:** After any chart renders, "Make Shareable Card" button. Three templates: clean, bold, dark. Auto-sizes to 1080x1080 (Instagram) or 1200x628 (Twitter/LinkedIn). Adds site watermark. Downloads as PNG. Pre-filled share text with data insight. Copy-paste ready.

## The Sharing Test

Before building, ask:

> "If someone shares this, does the content make sense without visiting the site?"

If the share is self-contained (image with data, card with insight), it spreads. If the share requires clicking through to understand, most people won't bother.

**Design for the screenshot. Build for the share.**

---

## What Makes Round 3 Different

- **Round 1** focused on **tools and games** (quizzes, calculators, maps)
- **Round 2** focused on **controversy and anxiety** (shame, fear, generational conflict)
- **Round 3** focuses on **sharing infrastructure and daily habits** (viral cards, briefings, decision tools, live data)

Round 3 is about **reducing friction** between seeing data and spreading data. Every feature either:
1. Makes existing content more shareable
2. Creates daily/regular engagement hooks
3. Provides genuine utility that earns bookmarks

The goal: turn every visitor into a content creator by making sharing effortless.

## The Greedy Stack

Build in this order to maximize compounding returns:

```
Layer 3: Controversy content (arguments spread)
         ↑ amplified by
Layer 2: Sharing tools (frictionless distribution)
         ↑ amplified by
Layer 1: Daily hooks (repeat visitors)
         ↑ built on
Layer 0: Core data features (what you have now)
```

Round 3 fills in Layer 1 and Layer 2 — the infrastructure that makes everything else spread faster.
