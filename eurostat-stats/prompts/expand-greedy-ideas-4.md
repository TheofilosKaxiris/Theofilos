## 10 NEW Greedy Ideas

---

### 1. The EU Crystal Ball: Data-Driven Predictions

**What:** AI-generated predictions for the next 5 years based on current trends. "Based on trajectory, Portugal will overtake Greece in GDP per capita by 2027." "Germany's workforce will shrink by 2 million by 2030."

**Why it's greedy:** Predictions are irresistible. People share them to either agree or argue. Unlike static data, predictions stake a claim about the future — that's inherently controversial. News outlets cite predictions. Social media debates them. "The data says X will happen" is more shareable than "X is happening now." Every prediction is a conversation starter.

**Max version:** Full prediction dashboard with confidence intervals. Track prediction accuracy over time (build credibility). User voting on which predictions they believe. "Prediction leaderboard" showing which forecasts came true. Scenario toggles (optimistic/pessimistic). Email alerts when predictions are about to come true or get invalidated. "What the data got wrong" retrospectives.

**Min version:** "2030 Outlook" page with 10 bold predictions. Each prediction: one sentence claim, the data trend it's based on, a simple projection chart. Examples: "Estonia will have the EU's oldest population by 2030." "Ireland's GDP per capita will exceed Luxembourg's." No ML needed — linear extrapolation + editorial angle. Share buttons per prediction.

---

### 2. The EU Relationship Status: Who Trades With Who

**What:** Interactive network visualization showing trade relationships between EU countries. Click any country to see its top trade partners, trade balance, and economic "best friends" and "rivalries."

**Why it's greedy:** Relationships are inherently interesting. "Germany's biggest customer is France but biggest supplier is China" tells a story. Trade wars, dependencies, and surprising partnerships all trigger curiosity. Network visualizations are visually stunning — people screenshot and share beautiful data art. It reveals hidden power dynamics.

**Max version:** Force-directed network graph with animated flows. Filter by product category (cars, food, machinery). Time slider showing how relationships evolved. "What would happen if X stopped trading with Y" scenario modeling. "Who needs who more?" power asymmetry scores. Country-pair deep dives with full trade breakdowns.

**Min version:** Each country page shows: Top 5 export destinations, Top 5 import sources, Trade surplus/deficit with each. Simple bar charts. "Economic Best Friend" highlighted (largest positive trade balance). "One-sided Relationship" highlighted (biggest deficit). Shareable cards: "Germany and Poland: BFFs" with trade stats.

---

### 3. The "Before I Was Born" Time Capsule

**What:** Enter your birth year. See what Europe looked like economically when you were born vs now. "When you were born, Spain's unemployment was 20%. The Berlin Wall was still up. Greece wasn't in the EU."

**Why it's greedy:** Personal nostalgia + data = engagement gold. Everyone wants to see their birth year. It's inherently shareable: "Look what Europe was like when I was born!" Generational comparison content without the "betrayal" angle — more curiosity than outrage. Perfect for birthdays. Parents share their kids' versions.

**Max version:** Full birth year experience. Side-by-side comparisons for every metric. "If you were born in X country, here's what your parents faced." Map of EU showing which countries existed (pre-1995 no Austria/Finland/Sweden, pre-2004 no Eastern expansion). "Time twin" — someone born the same year in a different country. Audio snippets of era-appropriate news. Shareable "My Birth Year Card."

**Min version:** Single page: birth year dropdown (1950-2010). Show 5 key metrics compared to today: average wage, unemployment, life expectancy, EU membership count, major economic event. Visual timeline of "what happened since." Pre-made shareable images. "Born in 1985? Here's your Europe."

---

### 4. The EU Speed Run: Fastest Improvers

**What:** Ranking of which countries improved the most in the last 5/10/20 years across different metrics. The "comeback stories" of Europe. Estonia's digital transformation. Ireland's Celtic Tiger. Poland's post-communist surge.

**Why it's greedy:** Success stories inspire shares from proud nationals. "We improved more than anyone" is a flex. Underdogs rising triggers emotional responses. It's the opposite of the Shame Index but equally shareable. Media loves "comeback" narratives. Rankings create competition and debate.

**Max version:** Interactive "improvement leaderboard" by metric and time period. "Speed run records" — fastest country to achieve X milestone. Animated race charts showing catch-up stories. "How did they do it?" policy explainers. Compare your country's speed run to others. "You're on track to..." progress projections.

**Min version:** "Europe's Fastest Climbers" page. Three time periods: 5yr, 10yr, 20yr. Top 3 improvers per category (economy, environment, quality of life). Show before/after numbers. Simple delta ranking. Highlight unexpected winners. Shareable cards: "Poland: +147% GDP per capita since 2004."

---

### 5. The Silent Crisis Detector: Things Nobody's Talking About

**What:** AI-curated feed of concerning trends that aren't making headlines. Slow-moving crises hidden in the data. "Portugal's youth are leaving faster than anywhere else." "Finland's birth rate just hit a historic low."

**Why it's greedy:** "What they don't want you to know" energy. People love being informed about hidden problems. It positions the site as the source that sees what others miss. Contrarian content spreads — being the first to notice something earns credibility. Journalists mine this for story ideas.

**Max version:** Weekly "Silent Crisis Report" auto-generated. Anomaly detection on all datasets. "Crisis Score" ranking hidden problems by severity. Historical comparison: "This pattern preceded X crisis." Email newsletter for subscribers. "You predicted it first" badges when mainstream media catches up. Community voting on which silent crises matter most.

**Min version:** "What Nobody's Talking About" page. Manually curated 5 concerning trends based on Signal Feed data. Each trend: headline stat, why it matters, chart showing the trajectory. Update monthly. Share buttons. Example: "Romania loses 100,000 people per year to emigration. That's a city disappearing annually."

---

### 6. The "Rich or Poor?" Perception Quiz

**What:** Show country stats without revealing which country. User guesses if it's a "rich" or "poor" EU country. Then reveal the surprising answer. "GDP per capita: €35K, Unemployment: 14%, Debt: 180% GDP" — Greece or Spain? Neither: Italy.

**Why it's greedy:** Quizzes are engagement magnets. This one challenges stereotypes. People get it wrong and share their surprise. "I thought X was rich/poor but look at these numbers." Reveals cognitive biases about European economies. Educational but fun. Perfect for social sharing: "I got 4/10 right, can you beat me?"

**Max version:** Full gamified quiz mode. Leaderboard of high scores. Different difficulty levels. "Versus" mode comparing specific countries. Stats trivia beyond economics (demographics, environment, quality of life). Daily challenge with new questions. Share challenge links to friends.

**Min version:** 10-question quiz. Each question shows 3-4 stats, ask user to pick the country from 4 options. Reveal answer with explanation of why it's surprising. Running score. Final "How European are you?" score. Share result image with score. "Most people get this wrong..." teasers.

---

### 7. The Two Europes: East vs West Dashboard

**What:** Permanent dashboard tracking the economic convergence (or divergence) between Eastern and Western Europe. The post-communist catch-up story in real time. "Is the gap closing or widening?"

**Why it's greedy:** East vs West is a fundamental European tension. Eastern Europeans want to see progress. Western Europeans want to understand the competition. It's a decades-long storyline with real stakes. Policy makers, investors, and citizens all care. The gap is emotionally charged — pride, resentment, hope.

**Max version:** Live convergence tracker updated with each data release. "Years until parity" calculator. Country-by-country within each bloc. Winners and losers of convergence. "The Great Catch-Up" animated historical chart. Policy analysis of what's driving convergence. "If this continues, by 2040..." projections.

**Min version:** Single dashboard page. Split screen: "West" (Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria) vs "East" (Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechia). 5 key metrics compared. Gap % shown with trend arrow. Simple "The gap closed by 3% this year" headlines. Historical chart of convergence since 2004. Share button.

---

### 8. The Data Playlist: Curated Story Collections

**What:** Themed collections of related charts and stats that tell a cohesive story. "The Aging Europe Story" (5 charts about demographics). "The Green Transition" (10 charts about environment). Like Spotify playlists but for data narratives.

**Why it's greedy:** Playlists remove decision paralysis. People don't know what to explore — give them a guided experience. Each playlist is shareable as a complete narrative. Teachers embed them for classes. Journalists use them for research. It's content curation that provides value. Bingeable data consumption.

**Max version:** User-created playlists with voting. "Top Playlists This Month." Collaborative playlists. "Playlist of the Week" featured. Embed codes for external sites. Slide show mode for presentations. Download as PDF report. AI-suggested playlists based on browsing history.

**Min version:** 5 hand-curated playlists on a gallery page. Each playlist: title, description, 5-10 charts in sequence. "Play All" button that cycles through charts. Example: "The COVID Economic Impact" playlist showing GDP drop → unemployment spike → recovery → inflation. Share full playlist or individual charts.

---

### 9. The "What's Your Country's Superpower?" Identity Card

**What:** For each EU country, identify the ONE thing they're best at in Europe. Not generic rankings — a single claim to fame. "Ireland: Highest GDP per capita." "Malta: Most tourists per capita." "Estonia: Most digital government."

**Why it's greedy:** Everyone wants to know what their country excels at. National pride in a single shareable fact. It's positive (unlike Shame Index) but still creates debate. "Why is THAT our superpower?" drives engagement. The cards are perfect for social sharing. Positive virality through pride.

**Max version:** Full "Superpower Analysis" per country. Primary superpower + runner-up categories. Historical superpowers (what were you best at in 2000?). "Superpower at risk" warnings if another country is catching up. Interactive: see who's best at any metric. "Claim your superpower" social share.

**Min version:** Gallery of 27 cards, one per country. Each card: flag, country name, "Europe's #1 in: [metric]" with the actual number. Back of card shows top 3 to prove they're actually #1. Shareable as image. Example: "Luxembourg: Europe's Richest (€115K GDP per capita)."

---

### 10. The Alternate History Calculator: "What If X Never Happened?"

**What:** Counter-factual simulations. "What if Greece never joined the Euro?" "What if Brexit happened in 2010?" "What if Germany reunified in 1980?" Projected alternate timelines based on data.

**Why it's greedy:** Alternate history is endlessly fascinating. Every counterfactual is an argument. Brexiteers vs Remainers would fight over the "What if Brexit never happened?" simulation. It's speculative but data-grounded. Historians, politicians, and normies all engage with "what if" content. Pure controversy bait.

**Max version:** Interactive scenario builder. Pick event, pick year, see projected alternate timeline. Multiple methodology options (optimistic/pessimistic). Cite your work to experts who've modeled these scenarios. Compare official projections with actual outcomes. "What if you were right?" — validators for past predictions.

**Min version:** 5 pre-built alternate history pages. Each one: "What if X?" headline, the actual timeline, the projected alternate timeline (based on reasonable assumptions), a comparison chart showing divergence. Written editorial explanation. Sources cited. Share buttons. Example: "What if Greece exited the Euro in 2015?"

## The Emotion Test

Before building, ask:

> "What emotion does this trigger — and do people share that emotion?"

| Emotion | Do They Share? | Feature Examples |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Pride | Yes — "Look at my country!" | Superpower Cards, Speed Run |
| Nostalgia | Yes — "Remember when?" | Before I Was Born |
| Curiosity | Yes — "Did you know?" | Silent Crisis, Trade Network |
| Surprise | Yes — "I can't believe..." | Rich or Poor Quiz, Predictions |
| Fear | Sometimes — "This is scary" | Silent Crisis, Two Europes |
| Anger | Yes — "This is wrong!" | Alternate History (for debate) |
| Boredom | Never | — avoid features that feel like homework |

**Optimize for pride, curiosity, and surprise.** Those spread fastest with least negativity.

## What Makes Round 4 Different

- **Round 1** focused on **tools and games** (build utility)
- **Round 2** focused on **controversy and anxiety** (build arguments)
- **Round 3** focused on **sharing infrastructure and habits** (build distribution)
- **Round 4** focuses on **identity, prediction, and discovery** (build emotional connection)

Round 4 is about making people feel something personal when they use the site:
1. Pride in their country's achievements (Superpower, Speed Run)
2. Curiosity about hidden truths (Silent Crisis, Trade Network)
3. Wonder about their place in time (Before I Was Born, Predictions)
4. Engagement through challenge (Rich or Poor Quiz)

The site stops being "a data tool" and becomes "my source for understanding Europe."

## The Ultimate Test

> "Would someone describe this site to a friend at dinner?"

If yes, you've built something greedy. If it's just "a data site," you haven't.

**Target description:** "There's this site that tells you what your country is best at in Europe and predicts what'll happen by 2030. I found out Estonia might have the oldest population soon and Italy's GDP is way worse than I thought."

That's a dinner conversation. That's word-of-mouth. That's greedy.
